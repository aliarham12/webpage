           HTML is an abbreviation for Hyper Text Markup Language.<br>
CSS is an abbreviation for Cascading Style Sheets.<br>
HTML is actually used to create the webpage and the content that it has, like the images and writing<br>
CSS is used to design the webpage and tell the writing and images to be in a certain place, like an image on the top of the page, another in the center etc...
          </p>
<h2>Step 1: What Is a Website Made Of?</h2>
          <p class="dark">
If you are surfing the web and find any website interesting and cool, and want to find out what and how it was made, or to find out what HTML coding they used, then all you need to do is,

<br>Right click on any blank area on the webpage.
<br>Click view page source
<br>This will open up a new window or a tab according to your settings showing the HTML code that the website runs on.
          </p>
<br><h4>Step 2: HTML, What Is It?</h4>
<br><p>HTML as I said before is<br>

Hyper Text Markup Language...<br>

Everything in HTML works by the use of 'Tags' , Tags are elements in an HTML document that give commands to the writing or images or audio or video files what to do, where to be placed etc in a website...<br>

In HTML, tags always have "<" before and ">" after the tag...
ex-<b> (This tag makes the text bold)

All HTML documents start and end with <br>

<HTML>
</HTML></p>

        </article>

        <aside id="sidebar">
          <div class="dark">
            <h3>Step 3: Basic Structure of an HTML Document</h3>
            <p>All HTML documents have a "Head" and a "Body" tag...<br>

So all HTML documents have a structure similar to this...<br>

<HTML>(Starting the html document)<br>
<HEAD>(Starting the head tag)<br>
</HEAD>(Ending the head tag) <br>
<BODY>(Starting the body tag)<br>
</BODY>(Ending the body tag)<br>
</HTML>(Ending the html document)<br>

NOTE : HTML tags are not case sensitive, this means that it does not matter if you write them with capitals or small letters...<br>

Every HTML tag, has an opening and a closing tag, and any content between those tags, gives that content the property the tag commands...ex: <b>...</b> (This is to bold the text)<br>
Some HTML tags have the opening and closing tag in the same tag...ex: <br /> (This is to break line) <br>

Whatever is in the body tags, is directly shown on the webpage, and whatever there is in the head tags, they define and give information about the webpage that is not seen when you view the page on a web browser.</p>
