          <h1 class="page-title">Review the Design Brief</h1>
          <p>Read through the design brief several times. Ascertain the client's budget and deadline for delivering the project assets. Completing the work by the due date is an essential character attribute for a professional designer.<br>

As you analyze the brief, scanning for keywords and deliverables, consider how long the design process will be and factor this into your work plan.<br>

Look for and highlight keywords related to industry, market, form factor, tone, and style. Learn more about this process: How to interpret and respond to a logo design brief.<br>

If you have the ability to speak to the client (verbally or online) then ask as many questions as you can. You want to fully understand the brief.<br>
          
          </p>
<h2>Step 2: Research and Discovery:</h2>
          <p class="dark">
Research will make you a better designer, saving you a lot of thinking time. This step is crucial. You'll become more engaged with the client's needs, making your design far superior than the rest. Don't skip this step if you're entering a freelance design contest, as some time spent on research (up to 30 mins) will give you an advantage.<br>

Look at:<br>

1)Understanding the business<br>
2)Target demographic (age, gender, location)<br>
3)History & culture of the brand<br>
4)Understanding the brand value and vision<br>
5)The client's industry and main competitors<br>
Including a focused or short research phase in your design process will sync your ideas together to answer the brief.</p>

            <h3>Step 3:  Brainstorm and Sketch Concepts:</h3>
            <p>{
 Now is the time to pull all your ideas together. Start by creating symbols or motifs. Explore and test typefaces and keep in mind the latest logo and graphic design trends when you're working. Make sure to jot all your ideas down.<br>
The benefits of sketching allows you to create designs quickly. You're also more free to create and there are no limits. (Programs like Adobe Illustrator can be very limiting, when you want to produce quick sketches.) You might find this guide to setting up digital illustrations useful.</p>}<br>
